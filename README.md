# ShockBridge

Small script that let's you use any steam vr controller input and translate that into an api call to Openshock for a "preditermined result"

Use responsibly

Instructions:

1- Have Python installed, then in cmd run: pip install openvr requests
2- Configure the ShockBridge file with your stuff (run the ButtonMappe first to see what button mask to use..)
3- Run with .bat, preferably run automatically using vrcx, (no I can't hide the window, Windows likes it's Windows okey?)
